          <h5>YOUR IMAGE IS OUR BUSINESS</h5>
          <p>Image is everything – whether you run your own small business from the back of a garage or you operate a large international company, image can be the difference between success and failure. When it comes to image, your workwear says a lot about who you are – both as a working professional and as a company. You are probably the best at what you do, and if not, you&rsquo;re probably trying hard to become the best. At Fristads Kansas, we can help you achieve this goal by providing you with customisable options to build and style your own workwear. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>HEAT TRANSFERS</h5>
          <p>Heat transfers give distinct, high quality prints with an increased level of detail and clear colours. A benefit of heat transfers is that they are very easyily applied to the workwear.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>EMBROIDERY</h5>
          <p>Embroidering straight onto the garment adds a touch of exclusivity taking the overall impression up a notch. Embroidery looks stylish and it is long lasting too.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>NAME EMBROIDERY</h5>
          <p>Embroidering people&rsquo;s names on their garments is an attractive way of labelling them. We usually embroider names above the breast pocket. The standard height is 10 mm but you can choose any size you like. Choose one of the styles shown, printed lettering or cursive, in the colour of your choice. The printed lettering can also be written in capitals or shown in an arch (no more than 4 lines).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>NAME TRANSFER</h5>
          <p>You can easily label your clothes with personal names using our name transfer method. The name is usually placed above the breast pocket and allows a maximum width of 10 cm. Choose between different styles in the most common colours.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h5>ENGRAVED NAME SIGNS</h5>
          </div>
          <p>We engrave name signs in plastic, silver or brass and print individual names as well as company logos. Choose oval or rectangular, printed or cursive. White plastic signs can have blue, red, black or green text and brass and silver come with black text. We print a maximum of two rows of text.</p>

            <p>Mark the return form, which is usually a tear-off strip from the packing slip, as instructed, including the reason for the return. Mark whether the item is a return or exchange.<br />
              <br />
              If it's an exchange, fill out the form by including the item specifics on what you want delivered in exchange--such as the new size, color or item.<br />
              <br />
              Wrap the item of clothing to be returned first in the plastic bag it came in, if possible. Then securely wrap the clothing and the return form either in the original shipping container or in a new one, removing or scratching out any old bar codes. Don't use the original shipping container if it's not in good shape, though--you want to be sure it arrives at its destination.<br />
              Address the package. Alternatively, use the prepaid return shipping label provided by the store, but be aware that you may be charged a fee for using it by the store (see the store policy).<br />
              <br />
              Bring the package to your preferred mailing depot. Do not use any form of delivery that requires signature confirmation, as these often cause delays or go astray and are against most stores' policies for returns.</p>
