<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To evaluate the success of my website, I can use the pageview which equal to number of people multiply by number of page they view. The most standard to evaluate a business website good or bad is its ability of making profit. Member is more important than viewer, because more members can bring more profit.
